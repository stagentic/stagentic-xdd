# Architecture Decisions

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture the *why* behind significant design choices in stagentic-tdd. Each ADR records the context, the decision, and the alternatives considered.

See [0000](0000-use-adrs-to-record-decisions.md) for more on ADRs, the rationale, the format, statuses, and conventions.

## How to add an ADR

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to `NNNN-short-slug.md` (next available number).
2. Fill in the sections.
3. Set status to `Proposed`.
4. Add a row in the index below.
